[x] make validPlay work

critical:
[x] rich history (i.e. show cards played)

[x] invisible button
[x] make phoenix high card in straight
[x] fix weirdness when bombing a winning trick

[x] fix scoring when third player goes out with the dragon

important:
[x] preserve local hand order after play
[x] make play / trick winner indicators more better
[x] click card to play/unplay
[x] bomb button
[x] observer mode
[x] let the VIP shuffle players before the game starts
[x] repro and fix passing dragging weirdness
[x] "gave" the trick, rather than "passed"
[x] disconnect message after game ends

nice to have:
[x] persistent button positioning in action bar
[x] validPlay optimization
[x] fancier hands for other players
[x] score box too small
[x] title box too small
[x] randomize teams when all players join
[x] alternate tichu-fail messages
[ ] pass undo when someone calls tichu?
[ ] score table
[ ] trick point counter
[ ] dark theme
[ ] new game button
[ ] fix passing replacement weirdness and re-enable swapping

[ ] centered play area of maximum size, as a stepping stone to dynamic card size
[ ] dynamic card size

wontfix:
[ ] fade at top of history -- looked a bit weird, fiddly to implement, a plain border works better
[ ] server-side history window -- game history is necessary to drive the score table on the client
[ ] possible_plays optimization - meh, this typically happens _once_; building a structure would be more expensive than the linear lookup
[ ] clean up fancy-hands code - meh, it ain't broke

done:
[X] eliminate Player token; use id for this purpose. don't expose id to other players; they just use index (0 = self)
[x] make protocol terser
[x] some sort of event log
[x] test play logic
[x] automated player that basically plays randomly
[x] fix action bar
[x] test card functions
[x] test MainPlayer PassSplay
[x] history catch-up
[x] test error
[x] make validPlay work

critical:
[x] rich history (i.e. show cards played)
[x] show who passed you which cards
[x] fix history scroll to bottom on update :rageface: :why:
[x] deploy to heroku
[x] assets on heroku
[x] wish modal, wishing
[x] wish visible
[x] scores always visible
[x] disconnect message
[x] keepalive for heroku
[x] don't allow bombing out of turn when there are no cards on the table
[x] inability to call tichu after passing?!
[x] invisible button
[x] make phoenix high card in straight
[x] fix weirdness when bombing a winning trick
[x] fix card order in history
[x] fix scoring when third player goes out with the dragon
[x] survive a dyno reboot (intercept SIGTERM and dump game state in Postgres)

important:
[x] preserve local hand order after play
[x] make play / trick winner indicators more better
[x] click card to play/unplay
[x] bomb button
[x] observer mode
[x] let the VIP shuffle players before the game starts
[x] repro and fix passing dragging weirdness
[x] "gave" the trick, rather than "passed"
[x] disconnect message after game ends
[x] short game option
[x] show cards left behind after round ends
[x] show what cards you passed
[x] make it noticeable when somebody calls tichu
[x] change label to "Play" when playing the 1 (still show wish dialog as before)
[x] deal with simultaneous bombing by teammates
[x] join game with link
[x] copy link from game
[x] player replacement
[x] show end-score
[x] improve tichu indicators
[x] make it *more* noticeable when somebody calls tichu
[x] turn prompt, maybe chime or something
[ ] investigate delaying chime if noises become confusing over zoom
[ ] let observers see players' cards via some kind of token sent out-of-band
[ ] let players change their minds about which cards to pass
[ ] reconnect without reloading the page

nice to have:
[x] persistent button positioning in action bar
[x] validPlay optimization
[x] fancier hands for other players
[x] score box too small
[x] title box too small
[x] randomize teams when all players join
[x] alternate tichu-fail messages
[x] card animations!!
[x] dark theme
[ ] pass undo when someone calls tichu?
[ ] score table
[ ] trick point counter
[ ] new game button
[ ] fix passing replacement weirdness and re-enable swapping
[ ] fix passing arrows when dragging out of a pass thing
[ ] centered play area of maximum size, as a stepping stone to dynamic card size
[ ] dynamic card size

wontfix:
[ ] fade at top of history -- looked a bit weird, fiddly to implement, a plain border works better
[ ] server-side history window -- game history is necessary to drive the score table on the client
[ ] possible_plays optimization - meh, this typically happens _once_; building a structure would be more expensive than the linear lookup
[ ] clean up fancy-hands code - meh, it ain't broke
